DeepRef is an fully open-source AI-powered note-taking app that transforms your research into interactive learning experiences.

## Problem statement
In today's digital age, researchers, students, and professionals face a significant challenge in managing the overwhelming amount of information they encounter during their research process. The current workflow is fragmented and inefficient - they need to constantly switch between browser tabs, note-taking apps, and study materials. Traditional note-taking tools are passive repositories that don't actively contribute to learning and retention. Users waste countless hours manually organizing web research, formatting notes, and creating study materials from their collected information. This disconnected approach leads to scattered knowledge, poor retention, and reduced research productivity.

## Proposed solution
DeepRef revolutionizes the research workflow by providing an intelligent, integrated platform that transforms how users capture, organize, and learn from their research:

1. **Seamless Web Integration**
    - The browser extension acts as your digital research assistant, allowing you to highlight and capture important information from any website directly into your notes. Whether it's academic papers, articles, or web resources, DeepRef preserves the context and automatically organizes the information within your research structure.
1. **Structured Knowledge Canvas**
    - The heart of DeepRef is its innovative canvas-based workspace. Unlike traditional linear note-taking, this dynamic environment lets you organize information spatially with customizable widgets. Create dedicated spaces for different research topics, add to-do lists for research tasks, maintain reference libraries, and visualize connections between different pieces of information.
1. **AI-Powered Learning Engine**
    - DeepRef's intelligent system analyzes your notes and automatically generates personalized learning materials. The AI understands the context and relationships in your research, creating targeted flashcards, interactive quizzes, and knowledge checks. This transforms passive notes into active learning tools, ensuring better understanding and long-term retention of the material.

This comprehensive solution bridges the gap between information gathering and knowledge retention, making research more efficient and effective. By automating the transition from web research to organized notes to active learning materials, DeepRef saves valuable time while improving research outcomes and knowledge retention.
